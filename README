KidsRuby Installer for OSX

This installer is based on Platypus (http://www.sveinbjorn.org/platypus). To install the command line tool, do this:
Download latest version and drop into /Applications, and then:
  cd /Applications/Platypus.app/Contents/Resources
  ./InstallCommandLineTool.sh
Now the command line tool to build a stand-alone installer is ready.

Get all other needed resources to build an installer by running install.sh

To actually build a stand-alone installer, run build_installer.sh

The script installer.sh is what Platypus uses for the installation process on an end-user computer

The appify.sh is used to package the KidsRuby launcher into a standalone app file.
