KidsRuby Installer for OSX

This installer is based on Platypus (http://www.sveinbjorn.org/platypus). To install the command line tool, do this:
Download latest version and drop into /Applications, and then:
  cd /Applications/Platypus.app/Contents/Resources
  ./InstallCommandLineTool.sh
Now the command line tool to build a stand-alone installer is ready.

Get all other needed resources to build an installer by running install.sh

Also, run install.sh each time you want to do a build, to get the latest version of KidsRuby editor from the 'release' branch

To actually build a stand-alone installer, run substituting the real version number for VERSION:
  build_installer.sh VERSION

The script installer.sh is what Platypus uses for the installation process on an end-user computer

The appify.sh is used to package the KidsRuby launcher into a standalone app file.
